[b]CrypTool 2 Release 2022.1[/b]

Dear CrypTool 2 users,

CrypTool 2 (CT2) is a free, open-source e-learning software about cryptography and cryptanalysis with a visual user interface. CT2 is used in schools, universities, companies, and administrations all over the world since more than 10 years.

In December 2022, we published the release "2022.1", which is the first release this year. The previous CT2 release was published in December 2021.

Over the year, we implemented several new classical cipher components (e.g. the Mexican Army cipher disk or the Bifid cipher and Trifid cipher), machine cipher components (all mechanical Hagelin ciphers in one component), as well as (re-)implemented modern cipher components (GOST Magma, HIGHT, and Trivium). Additionally, we updated and fixed many existing components, templates, etc. Furthermore, we aligned our language model handling across all cryptanalysis components. Also, the Syllabary cipher component is a new component and the actual cipher got a lot of attention on MysteryTwister C3 (https://www.mysterytwister.org) as we published several Syllabary cipher challenges. Finally, the RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response) component, which visualizes the RAPPOR privacy technology from Google, was implemented in a bachelor's thesis and added to CrypTool 2.

Another interesting thing worth mentioning is the official CrypTool 2 YouTube channel "Cryptography for everybody", which reached a 4500 subscriber count in December 2022. Thank you! For those who did not have a look at the channel: We discuss and explain cryptologic topics and show many examples using CrypTool 2 and the other CrypTool implementations of the project (see https://www.youtube.com/c/CrypTool2/).

Thanks for the many users who sent feedback, requests, laud, and criticism.

We hope that you have as much fun using CT2 as we have creating it!

Stay safe and healthy!

Sincerely yours,
The CrypTool 2 Developer Team, December 2022

Changelog summary
------------------------
Here is a more detailed summary of the updates and additions.

Language Support:
We had to remove the Chinese and Russian language due to a lack of support of native speakers. Maintaining already two languages (English and German) is a lot of work, so we decided to remove the (poorly and automatic translated) two other languages.

------------------------
New components
------------------------
Hagelin Machine
- created a component implementing many different Hagelin machines, including e.g. the CX52a, CX52b, and the M209
- hint: in this release version, component is only available in English language (template and online help are also available in German)

Mexican Army Cipher Disk

Mexican Army Cipher Disk Analyzer

Syllabary cipher
- created a new Syllabary Cipher component based on the description of William Friedman in Military Cryptanalysis and the descriptions of the ACA

GOST Magma
- created a new component implementing the "Russian DES cipher" (GOST Magma)

Book cipher

Bifid cipher

Trifid cipher

RAPPOR
- added the RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response) component which visualizes the RAPPOR privacy technology

------------------------
Existing components
------------------------
Vigenerè cipher
- added Beaufort and Beaufort autokey mode

Playfair analyzer
- changed to standard CT2 language models. This allows to analyze Playfair ciphers using all implemented languages and no need for downloading an additional file via CrypToolStore

Vigenerè analyzer
- cost function values are now normalized (between 0 and 10 million)

Monoalphabetic Substitution Analyzer
- cost function values are now normalized (between 0 and 10 million)

FEAL cipher
- fixed FEAL-4 implementation. Last round(s) were handled incorrectly. Since we do not have any official test vectors for FEAL-4, we are not 100% sure if FEAL-4 is now correctly implemented

Byte Array Operations
- a new component offering functions to work with byte arrays, e.g. concatenate, sub array, etc.

Substitution cipher
- The substitution component now supports linebreaks using \n
- The user is now able to set the number of shown "mappings" in the presentation

CrypToolStore
- some small fixes

Workspace Manager
- some small fixes

PKCS5 and PBKDF
- added null check for key and salt

Transposition Analyzer and Transposition component
- Transposition analysis now supports ranges of key sizes (min and max). Thus, the user does not have to restart the analysis when he wants to test different ranges in a row
- cost function values are now normalized (between 0 and 10 million)
- some small fixes

RSA Key Generator
- now also supports generating of safe primes
- now also has output connectors providing p and q

Random Number Generator
- completely reworked internal architecture of RandomNumberGenerator component
- each rng now outputs its "original" values instead of generating single bits to generate new values (which was very slow)
- the above mentioned changes increase performance of random number generation significantly
- implemented four versions of XORShift

Webcam
- changed method for enumerating webcams (should work now)
- added new library that easily allows the enumeration of webcams

VIC cipher
- fixed handling of inputs; now you don't need to execute VIC twice when alphabet is changed
- improved error messages

Startcenter/CrypWin
- Startcenter is always automatically shown when CT2 is started
- removed option to disable Startcenter showing up at startup of CT2
- some small fixes

WorkspaceManager
- fixed a logic error which allowed to add images and memo fields while workspace is executed
- memo fields and images cannot be deleted any more while workspace is executed
- when settings are shown/hidden, they now don't appear shortened in the ui
- removed possibility to execute workspace while it is being loaded
- some small fixes

Alphabet Permutator
- the Alphabet Permutator now generates plaintext and ciphertext alphabets based on the American Cryptogram Association (ACA) definitions (keying schemes K1, K2, K3, and K4)
- a shift value obtained via input now overwrites the shift value obtained via setting

Substitution
- increased font size in Substitution component's presentation

TextOutput
- line breaks can now be changed to "Don't change", "Windows", and "Unix"
- the TextOutput component now differentiates between "showing diff" and "not showing diff" by using a TextBox control instead of RichTextBox control. Thus, when copying from "non-diffed" outputs, there is no additional linebreak at the end of the copied text
- changed the behavior of (and fixed) UNIX output: Now, \r\n is just replaced by \n when option is selected

TextInput, TextOutput, NumberInput
- added default FontFamily and FontSize parameters to constructors of presentations
- added corresponding default arguments to constructor calls
- some refactoring: renaming of member variables

AES cipher
- 0-padding is removed by the AES component when decrypting a ciphertext
- fixed padding modes: StripPadding and AppendPadding are only used in 01-padding as the AES implementation in System.Security.Cryptography also implements other padding modes
- renamed ANSIX923 to ANSIX9.23

StringOperations
- some small fixes

Nihilist cipher
- completely rewrote Nihilist cipher component
-- it now has the correct input and output connectors with correct data types
-- it now supports 25 letter and 36 symbol (letters + digits) alphabets
-- it supports handling of unknown symbols

Homophonic Substitution Analyzer
- several small changes and fixes

HIGHT cipher
- completely re-implemented the HIGHT cipher implementation of CrypTool 2
- deleted old CrypPluginsExperimental version

Trivium
- completely re-implemented the Trivium cipher component (now it supports CrypToolStreams and byte arrays instead of strings)
- removed "cube attack", which was based on the old implementation of Trivium

Wizard
- performed some updates according to changed templates and components
- some small fixes

Various analysis components
- top list are now auto scrolled to the beginning when new entries are added
