[b]CrypTool 2 Release 2021.2[/b]

Dear CrypTool 2 users,

CrypTool 2 (CT2) is a free, open-source e-learning software about cryptography and cryptanalysis with a visual user interface. CT2 is used in schools, universities, companies, and administrations all over the world since more than 10 years.

In December 2021, we published the release "2021.2", which is the second release this year. The last CT2 release was published in May 2021.

The probably most interesting new implementation of CrypTool 2 is the blockchain simulation. Using the blockchain component and its corresponding templates, you can simulate a blockchain. The blockchain simulation allows to create blocks, transactions, addresses, and according digital signatures.

Another interesting thing worth mentioning is the official CrypTool 2 YouTube channel "Cryptography for everybody", which reached a 3100 subscriber count in December 2021. Thank you! For those who did not have a look at the channel: We discuss and explain cryptologic topics and show many examples using CrypTool 2 and the other CrypTool implementations of the project (See https://www.youtube.com/c/CrypTool2/).

Finally, there was a German article about CrypTool 2 in heise online and in Europe's biggest IT magazine, c't.

Thanks for the many users who sent feedback, requests, laud, and criticism.

We hope that you have as much fun using CT2 as we have creating it!

Stay safe and healthy!

Sincerely yours,
The CrypTool 2 Developer Team, December 2021
